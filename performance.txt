Performance is crucial in a Flutter app, yet often overlooked.
It involves efficient CPU usage, component rendering, event handling, and memory leak detection.
Key strategies include using DevTools to analyse CPU usage and request timings, and disposing of controllers to prevent memory leaks.
Minimise rebuilds with the const keyword, use efficient state management, and avoid large image sizes by utilising tools like Lottie.
For large datasets, implement pagination, and optimise local storage use. 
Ensure secure communication through certificate pinning.
